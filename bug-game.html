        <h1>🐛 Bug Squash Game</h1>

        <div class="content-box">
            <h2>About the Game</h2>
            <p>This is a game I made where you click on bugs (worms) to squash them! The bugs move around and you have 30 seconds to squash as many as you can. It keeps track of your score.</p>

            <h2>Game Features</h2>
            <div class="game-features">
                <div class="feature">
                    <h3>Click to Squash</h3>
                    <p>Click on any worm to squash it and get 1 point!</p>
                </div>
                <div class="feature">
                    <h3>Timer</h3>
                    <p>You have 30 seconds to get as many points as possible.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="feature">
                    <h3>Moving Bugs</h3>
                    <p>The worms move left and right and look like they're crawling!</p>
                </div>
                <div class="feature">
                    <h3>Score Tracker</h3>
                    <p>Your score shows up on the screen so you know how you're doing.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <h2>How to Play</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>When the game starts, 4 worms appear on the screen</li>
                <li>Click on any worm to squash it</li>
                <li>When you squash a worm, a new one appears</li>
                <li>Keep squashing until time runs out</li>
                <li>Try to get the highest score!</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>How I Made It</h2>
            
            <div class="info-box">
                <h3>The Worm Animation</h3>
                <p>I used 3 different pictures of a worm to make it look like it's moving. The code switches between the pictures really fast to make an animation.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="info-box">
                <h3>Making Them Move</h3>
                <p>Each worm moves left or right. When it hits the edge of the screen, it bounces and goes the other way!</p>
            </div>

            <div class="info-box">
                <h3>Clicking on Worms</h3>
                <p>I used onclick to make something happen when you click a worm. When you click it, the worm changes to a squashed picture, then disappears and a new one appears.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="info-box">
                <h3>The Timer</h3>
                <p>The timer counts down from 30 seconds. When it hits 0, the game says "GAME OVER" and all the worms disappear.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>What I Learned</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>How to make animations with different pictures</li>
                <li>How to make things you can click on</li>
                <li>How to use timers in Python</li>
                <li>How to keep track of a score</li>
                <li>How to make things move and bounce</li>
                <li>How to use lists to keep track of multiple things</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Things I Could Add</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Different types of bugs worth different points</li>
                <li>A high score that saves your best score</li>
                <li>Sounds when you squash a bug</li>
                <li>Power-ups that give you extra time or points</li>
                <li>Different levels that get harder</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Why I Made This</h2>
            <p>I wanted to make a fun game that was simple but also challenging. It was cool to figure out how to make the worms move around and how to make them clickable. The hardest part was making sure a new worm appeared right after you squashed one!</p>
